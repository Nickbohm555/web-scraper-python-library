## Overview

For many, collecting product data can be helpful for monitoring price changes or helping decide which e-commerce site to purchase from. However, creating a web scraper from scratch can be cumbersome and time consuming. My goal is to make it easier for people to collect product data, and this Python library aims to simplify the web scraping process. With basic inputs like product information and store url, you can have easy access to rich product information.
